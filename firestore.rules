/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for NewsFlash Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and reading history,
 * while allowing public read access to news articles and trending news.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under /users/{userId} and are accessible only to the user.
 * - Reading history is stored under /users/{userId}/readingHistory/{readingHistoryId} and is accessible only to the user.
 * - News articles are stored under /newsArticles/{articleId} and are publicly readable.
 * - Trending news is stored under /trendingNews/{trendingNewsId} and is publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is not allowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to news articles and trending news.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles and reading history.
 * - Data consistency is validated between the path and the document's internal fields for user-owned data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The /users/{userId}/readingHistory/{readingHistoryId} path inherently denormalizes the user-reading history relationship,
 * eliminating the need for costly `get()` calls to verify user ownership. The 'userId' field within the ReadingHistory
 * entity is maintained for data integrity and potential future use cases, although it's not strictly required for authorization due to the path.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The application uses separate collections for user-specific private data (user profiles and reading history) and
 * public data (news articles and trending news). This simplifies security rules and improves query performance.
